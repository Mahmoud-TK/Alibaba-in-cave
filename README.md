# Alibaba-in-cave
Ali Baba and his thieves enter a cave that contains a set of n types of items from which they are to 
select some number of items to be theft. Each item type has a weight, a profit and a number of 
available instances. Their objective is to choose the set of items that fits the possible load of their 
Camels and maximizes the profit. Note the following:
1- The array of items is 1-based, i.e. the first item is placed at index 1 not index 0
2- Each item should be taken as a whole (i.e. they canâ€™t take part of it)
3- They can take the same item one or more time (according to its number of instances)
